# React challange - Garden Waste


I appreciated the initial layout and made some improvements to enhance responsiveness, while preserving the original functionality and ensuring ease of maintenance.

The main changes include:

- Mobile adaptation: In the provided layout, the progress header did not scroll fully on mobile devices, so adjustments were made to ensure full visibility and usability on smaller screens.

- Skip selection behavior: Skips are now visually disabled and cannot be selected when they are not eligible to road.

- Footer display logic: The footer container only appears once a skip has been selected, improving interface clarity and reducing clutter.

- Process continuation logic: It is no longer mandatory to click the 'Continue' button in the footer. If a user clicks the already selected skip a second time, the process will automatically proceed, offering a more intuitive interaction
